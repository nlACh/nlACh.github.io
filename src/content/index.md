Hi! Welcome to my site!!

I am a Junior Research Fellow in the Quantum Materials and Digital Microfluidics Research Group at the Department of Electronics Science, University of Calcutta, India.

My primary research delves into the modeling of quantum transport in nanoscale electronic devices, particularly for quantum computing and advanced beyond Moore devices. My aim is to understand the transport properties of gate voltage assisted quantum dots in the channel of nanoscale field effect transistor devices to explore qubit generation and multi-valued logic devices.

I have expertise in Non-Equilibrium Green's Function techniques and its application in state of nanoscale field effect transistors (finFETs and nanowire FETs).

Apart from these, I also have experience in semiconductor device fabrication, particularly, electron beam lithography.
