_Hi! Welcome to my site!!_

I am a _Junior Research Fellow_ in the __Quantum Scale Materials and Digital Microfluidics Research Group (QMat&DigiMF)__ at the __Department of Electronic Science, University of Calcutta__, India.

My primary research delves into the modeling of quantum transport in nanoscale electronic devices, particularly for quantum computing and advanced beyond Moore devices. My aim is to understand the transport properties of gate voltage assisted quantum dots in the channel of nanoscale field effect transistor devices to explore qubit generation and multi-valued logic devices.

I have expertise in Non-Equilibrium Green's Function techniques and its application in modeling of nanoscale field effect transistors (finFETs and nanowire FETs), quantum dots and other quantum scale devices.

I also have experience in semiconductor device fabrication, particularly, electron beam lithography.
