_Hi! I am Nilayan and welcome to my site!!_


I am a _Junior Research Fellow_ in the __Quantum Scale Materials and Digital Microfluidics Research Group (QMat&DigiMF)__ led by Professor [Sanatan Chattopadhyay](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sanatan-Chattopadhyay) at the [Department of Electronic Science](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/ElcSc.html), [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/), India.

My primary research delves into the modeling of quantum transport in nanoscale electronic devices, particularly for quantum computing and advanced "beyond Moore" devices. In this context, my aim is to understand and model the transport properties of gate voltage assisted/tunable quantum dots ([VAQDs/VTQDs](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.15.054060)) in the channel of quantum-scale field effect transistor devices (FETs) to explore qubit generation and multi-valued logic devices.

I have expertise in Non-Equilibrium Green's Function techniques and its application in modeling of nanoscale field effect transistors (finFETs and nanowire FETs), quantum dots and other quantum scale devices.

I also have experience in semiconductor device fabrication, particularly, electron beam lithography.

My work is supported by fellowship from the University Grants Commission, India.
