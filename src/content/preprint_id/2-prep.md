abstract: "The article deals with the modeling of gate voltage controlled resonant tunneling transport in a CMOS compatible double quantum dot channel nanowire FET. The appropriate applied voltages at two separate gates, gate-1 and gate-2 of this device form two voltage-tunable quantum dots underneath the gates, within the nanowire channel. The quantum dot eigenstates are tuned by varying the applied gate voltages to enable voltage-modulated resonant tunneling transport. Such transport is modeled by employing a Schrödinger-Poisson self-consistent framework coupled with non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) formalism. The electron-phonon scattering within the nanowire channel is also considered. The transfer characteristics exhibit multiple threshold currents in the range of 10^-4 μA/μm – 1 μA/μm due to such resonant tunneling. The phonon scattering is observed to significantly depend on the nanowire geometry and applied gate voltages, and tunneling dominated quasi-ballistic transport occurs at higher gate voltages. Also, steep sub-threshold slopes of 45 mV/decade – 8 mV/decade range and transconductance in the 10^-7 μS/μm – 1 μS/μm range at room temperature are obtained by varying the nanowire diameter in the range of 20 nm – 5 nm. Therefore, such device architecture exhibits significant potential for achieving multi-current thresholds in a CMOS compatible architecture at room temperature."
